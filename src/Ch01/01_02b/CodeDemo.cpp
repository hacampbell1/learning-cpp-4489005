// IO Stream helps recieve text from keyboard and helps print things on a screen
#include <iostream>

#include <string>

// Starting function block with "int" to represent initialize

// start and end block of code with curly brackets
int main(){
    //STD = standard libary
    // cout = character output --> telling it to output it into the terminal
    std::cout << "Hi There" << std::endl;
